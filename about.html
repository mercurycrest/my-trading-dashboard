                <p class="founder-intro"><strong>As a retail trader, I've lived the struggle.</strong></p>

                <p class="about-text">
                    Navigating the fast-paced world of options trading, I found myself constantly juggling multiple tabs, 
                    hunting for critical data points while the market moved against me. Every second counted, yet the tools 
                    available forced me to choose between speed and information. I watched opportunities slip away—not because 
                    of poor analysis, but because the right data wasn't at my fingertips when I needed it most.
                </p>

                <p class="about-text">
                    <strong>That frustration became my motivation.</strong>
                </p>

                <p class="about-text">
                    I built the solution I wished I had: an all-in-one options trading dashboard that consolidates every 
                    essential data point into a single, intuitive interface. No more tab switching. No more missed opportunities. 
                    Just clear, actionable insights when you need them.
                </p>

                <p class="about-text">
                    Mercury Crest was founded on a simple belief: <strong>retail traders deserve institutional-grade tools 
                    without the institutional complexity.</strong> We've spent 5 years in the stock market industry, and we know 
                    that the gap between retail and institutional trading isn't just about capital—it's about access to smart, 
                    organized data.
                </p>

                <p class="about-text">

                    for traders who make their own decisions and need reliable information to back them up.
